    You are strongly advised to perform your own investigation prior to selecting a Healthcare Provider by making confirming telephone calls to the appropriate licensing or certification authorities to verify listed credentials and education, and to further verify information about a particular Healthcare Provider by confirming with the Healthcare Provider’s office, your current Healthcare Providers, the medical association(s) relevant to the Healthcare Provider’s specialty and your state medical board(s).

    <h4>4. AUTHORIZATION AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT; IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTHCARE PROVIDER RELATIONSHIPS AND LISTS </h4>
    In connection with using the Site and the Services to locate and schedule appointments with Healthcare Providers, you understand that:
    YOU ARE ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR CHOOSING YOUR OWN HEALTHCARE PROVIDER.
    Healthcare Providers listed through the Services with whom you may book appointments enter into contracts with us, and may pay us a fee in order to be marketed through the Services. We will provide you with lists and/or profile previews of Healthcare Providers who may be suitable to provide the healthcare services you seek based on information that you provide to us (such as insurance information, geographical location, and healthcare specialty). In an effort to aid in the discovery of Healthcare Providers and enable the maximum choice and diversity of Healthcare Providers participating in the Services, these lists and/or profile previews may also be based on other criteria (including, for example, Healthcare Provider availability, past selections by and/or ratings of Healthcare Providers by you or by other FindHospitals users, and past experience of FindHospitals users with Healthcare Providers); but FindHospitals (a) does not recommend or endorse any Healthcare Providers, (b) does not make any representations or warranties with respect to these Healthcare Providers or the quality of the healthcare services they may provide, and (c) does not receive any additional fees from Healthcare Providers for featuring them (i.e., higher or better placement on lists) through the Services. Note, however, to the extent that you use the Services as provided by your employer, FindHospitals may provide lists and/or profile previews based also on criteria determined by your employer and your employer’s agents or advisors.
    <p>  FindHospitals uses reasonable efforts to ensure that Healthcare Providers only participate in the Services if they hold all active licenses required by law to practice the specialties of the services offered by them, and are not excluded from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. FindHospitals may exclude Healthcare Providers who, in FindHospitals' discretion, have engaged in inappropriate or unprofessional conduct.</p>

    <p>If you elect to enter information into a medical history form ("Medical History Form") on behalf of yourself or a third party from whom you have authorization to provide such information, on your request you authorize us to provide such information to the specified Healthcare Provider. You acknowledge and agree that such information will be reviewed and approved by you or someone authorized by you at the time of your appointment to ensure its accuracy. You also acknowledge that FindHospitals may use the data or information you provide on a Medical History Form in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
